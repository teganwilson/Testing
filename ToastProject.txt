Toast object:
    Is created plain
    Can be toasted
    Can have toppings added to it
    Can return current toppings and current toastiness
    Can be cleared (for use with Tory class)

Tory object:
    Creates the criteria to "judge" toast
        Randomly creates a Toast object to be used as the criteria
        To do this, Tory clears the toast used last
    Takes a toast object (the user's) and "judges" based on the criteria
    Tory HAS A Toast object that it creates as its criteria
    Can return the current criteria
    
Questions:
    Should we create a toppings class? (probably no)
    Currently, Tory HAS A Toast object to judge upon and create criteria with. Is this good, or should we be doing something else?
    Where will graphics stuff be dealt with? Should there be a graphical component of the model, or does the view deal with that itself?
